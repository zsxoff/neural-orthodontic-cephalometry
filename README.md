> The efficiency of deep learning algorithms for detecting anatomical reference points on radiological images of the head profile.

This repository describes the solution to the problem of detecting anatomical reference points on radiological images of the head profile for orthodontic analysis based on convolution neural networks. In this study, the definition of reference points on the radiological for cephalometry problems used.

As the considered networks were selected convolutional networks of the sequential convolutional layers and U-Net architecture.
